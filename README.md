# BEE_102_assignment_23114010

Assignement of course BEE-102 

The input and output for 3rd question (fasta) are present in the 3_input_output folder 

I have included all the ipynb files but not the data files. The input data files can easily be imported in the zip formats. The input data files should be in the same directory as the ipynb files.
